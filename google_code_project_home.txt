PSX Emulator with Rerecording features

PSX Emulator with Rerecording features adapted from the PCSX GPU core

PSXjin is an overhaul of the outdated pcsx-rr branch of PCSX. It includes a new SPU and integrated components rather than the use of plugins (though currently input plugins are still required and packaged with PSXjin). In addition there is an overhaul of the GUI components & features, including the removal of the 2 window design inherent in PCSX emulators.

PSXjin is a rerecording emulator and its primary focus is to facilitate the making of Tool-assisted Speedruns (http://tasvideos.org/). When possible & time permitting it will also support features for casual gaming.
