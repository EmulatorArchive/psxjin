= How to record AVI files with PCSX and .kkapture =

== Step 1: Configure PCSX. ==
  # Go to "Configuration"->"Options" and make sure "Pause After Playback" is unchecked and then press "OK".
  # Go to "Configuration"->"Graphics" and select the final resolution the video will have.
  # Make sure these 3 checkboxes are unchecked:
  # *`*`NEW SINCE v0.0.08`*`* Make sure ".kkapture mode" is checked:

== Step 2: Using .kkapture. ==
  # Download [http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkapture/ .kkapture] and run it.
  # In the "Demo" field click on "Browse..." and select your "pcsx.exe" file.
  # In the "Arguments" field you can write something like "-play movies/example.pxm" if you want PCSX to load automatically a movie at start.
  # In the "Encoder" field select ".AVI (VfW, segmented)"
  # Pick any codec you like and configure it.
  # Make sure both "Capture Video" and "Capture Audio" boxes are checked.
  # You can leave everything else as you like; I haven't found any difference with those options enabled/disabled.
  # You should end with something like this:

Press kkapture! and wait until your movie is over. Then press the "Escape" key on PCSX and close it to finalize your .avi file.

== Notes ==
  * The "Encoder" setting ".AVI (VfW, segmented)" has a 2GB segment limit. You'll need to combine the files afterwards.
  * If for any strange reason PCSX doesn't correctly shut down at the end while capturing it, the video will most likely be broken. So, try pressing CTRL-BREAK at the end and .kkapture should terminate then and close the avi file properly.
