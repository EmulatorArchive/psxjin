= How to record AVIs with PCSX, an introduction =

Hi! We're now going to see the three main ways in which you can record your PXM movie into an AVI file!

== 1. Easiest/Ugly Way ==

===Steps===
*1.* Start your emulator and choose File->Movie->Record AVI...

*2.* Pick a codec, load your pxm, play, whatever.

*3.* Stop the recording.

You now have two files in your selected destination: example.avi and example.wav. Join them together with any video software and now you're ready to go!

===Results===
Example: [http://pcsxrr.googlecode.com/files/croc-1.avi croc-1.avi]

Quality: -10/10.

Conclusion: Unless you like shitty sound or you have a really fast computer, you better ignore this option.

== 2. Somewhat Better Way If You Have A Decent Computer Or Enjoy Messing With VirtualDub Or Audacity And You're Playing Off From A CD Image ==

===Steps===
*1.* Start your emulator from the command line two times, like this:

pcsx.exe -play movies/example.pxm -dumpavi example.avi -stopcapture 7898

pcsx.exe -play movies/example.pxm -dumpwav example.wav -stopcapture 7898

(replace 7898 with whatever frame number you prefer)

*2.* After both files have been saved, join them together or whatever. They should have the same length, if they do not, you will need to fix the sound length using VirtualDub or Audacity (this means your computer was not fast enough or maybe you've been using a slow CD drive).

===Results===
Example: [http://pcsxrr.googlecode.com/files/croc-2.avi croc-2.avi]

Quality: for decent computers this might work ok, I guess

Conclusion: Download .kkapture already and stop wasting your time.

== 3. Even My Computer Can Handle This Option ==

===Steps===
*1.* Download [http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkapture/ .kkapture].

*2.* Run PCSX first and configure your GPU plugin like this:

1: Uncheck those 2 boxes.

2: Pick the resolution in which the final video will be.

*3.* Close PCSX and run .kkapture.

1: In the "Demo" field browse and pick your pcsx.exe file.

2: In "Arguments" write: -play movies/example.pxm -dumpavi example.avi

3: In "Encoder" select ".BMP/.WAV writer".

4: Uncheck the "Capture Video" box.

5: You can leave the default settings for everything else, only god knows what do they do.

It should look something like this:

*4.* Now just press "kkapture!" and PCSX will start immediately and encode your movie.

*5.* After the movie is over press Escape and close PCSX, otherwise .kkapture will continue recording a .WAV file while you're writing a wiki page and your disc might get full.

===Results===
Example: [http://pcsxrr.googlecode.com/files/croc-3.avi croc-3.avi]

Quality: this is the only way my computer can make an .AVI file without sound drift.

Conclusion: You should use this option.
