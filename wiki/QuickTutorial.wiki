#summary PCSX-rr quick tutorial for first-time users.

= PCSX Tutorial =

When first running PCSX, the plugin and BIOS setup will appear as follows. *Don't use this setup.*

=== Graphics plugins ===

If you are TASing, the only plugin you should use is the TAS GPU Plugin that comes with PCSX-rr. Otherwise, you can use whatever you want.

=== Sound plugins ===

Sound plugins are the most likely factor that affects the timing of movies.

There are a number of SPU plugins:

 * No Sound plugin, which mutes the sound. Used if sound is a problem. Is stable and has the same timing as TAS SPU plugin with the movie sync flag checked.
 * TAS SPU plugin with movie sync on. This is stable, but some games have their sounds cut off or reduced in quality.

 * TAS SPU plugin with movie sync off. This is not as stable, but may have better sound quality.
 * [http://www.emuxhaven.net/emuxhaven/psx/plugin/spuEternal141_win.zip Eternal SPU]. This is not as stable, but has very good sound quality.

Both sound quality and stability are a big deal in TASing, and have to be handled per game so do some tests if you are not sure, and report to the [http://tasvideos.org/forum/ TASVideos forum]. Note that it is possible to encode Eternal SPU sound quality even if the plugin does not sync with the movie, but it requires a lot of work to do, and depends on the game.

=== Input plugins ===

Segu plugins come with PCSX-rr but you can also choose [http://www.emulator-zone.com/download.php/emulators/psx/plugins/controller/nrage/padnrageplugin.zip NRage plugin], which has the advantage of saving controller profiles, although there is a config interface bug ("L2" is L1, "R2" is L2, "L1" is R2).

=== CD-ROM plugins ===

The easiest one to use is TAS ISO plugin, which allows you to set a default ROM image to use.

=== BIOS ===

Do not use Internal HLE Bios.

Instead, use either SCPHxx01.BIN for NTSC-U games, SCPHxx00.BIN or SCPHxx03.BIN for NTSC-J games, or SCPHxx02.BIN for PAL games. SCPH1001.BIN is recommended for NTSC-U games on TASVideos.org. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_%28console%29 Wikipedia] for more information.

You must find the BIOS files yourself.
